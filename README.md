# finding-combo 
Implementation of the techniques described in the paper "Attempting to find infinite combos in fighting games using hidden markov models"

Basically uses Hidden Markov Models and supervised learning to train a machine to find large combos inside fighting games. The consultations are made using the viterbi algorithm.
